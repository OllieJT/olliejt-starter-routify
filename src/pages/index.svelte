		<strong>NEWARK, NJ – AUGUST 17, 2020</strong>
		: Dignitas, the esports vertical of New Meta Entertainment Inc. (NME), has today
		announced an expanded partnership with Esports Entertainment Group’s VIE.gg. The
		online exchange betting platform, VIE.gg, became an official multi-year partner
		of Dignitas in June 2019 and in April 2020 became the first publicly traded
		esports wagering company, listing its common shares on the NASDAQ, under the
		symbol “GMBL”. Today marks an expansion of that partnership as VIE.gg secures
		the naming rights of the organization’s famed CS:GO team.

	</p>
	<p>
		VIE.gg is the first and most transparent esports bet exchange as a result of
		Esports Entertainment Group being a fully reporting SEC issuer in the United
		States. Player safety features built into VIE.gg create a fun but responsible
		esports betting experience for fans.
	</p>
	<p>
		In addition to VIE.gg’s integration into the CS:GO naming rights and jersey, the
		partners will roll out strategic digital and physical activations with the New
		Jersey marketplace as a core focus. In June 2018, New Jersey Governor Phil
		Murphy signed Assembly Bill 411, legalizing sports betting in New Jersey. One
		year later, Dignitas became the first esports organization to open an esports
		training facility in Newark, New Jersey, next to the famed sports and
		entertainment facility, Prudential Center. In addition to U.S. sports betting,
		the partnership also paves the way into the European marketplace through
		association with Dignitas’ famed CS:GO team hailing from Scandinavia.

	<p>
		Esports Entertainment Group, a member of ESIC, is working together with NME, to
		ensure that conflicts of interest and betting and age requirement rules are
		withheld throughout.
